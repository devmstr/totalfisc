## Demo Script

### Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Demo environment loaded with sample data
- [ ] Screen sharing tested
- [ ] Customer name/logo in demo (personalization)
- [ ] Backup plan if demo breaks
- [ ] Water, notes ready

### Demo Flow (45 minutes)

#### Part 1: Introduction (5 min)

**Agenda:**
"Today I'll show you how TOTALFISC can help [Company] solve [pain points from discovery]. We'll cover:
1. Creating journal entries (10 min)
2. Generating reports (10 min)
3. Compliance features (10 min)
4. Q&A (10 min)

Feel free to interrupt with questions anytime!"

---

#### Part 2: Dashboard & Navigation (5 min)

**Script:**
"Let me start by showing you the dashboard. Notice how clean and modern it is—very different from PCCOMPTA's cluttered interface.

[Click through menu]

Here's the main menu. Everything is organized logically:
- **Accounting**: Journals, entries, chart of accounts
- **Third Parties**: Clients, suppliers, employees
- **Reports**: Trial balance, financial statements, tax reports
- **Settings**: Users, fiscal years, company info

Let's dive into creating a journal entry..."

---

#### Part 3: Create Journal Entry (10 min)

**Script:**
"Let's say you just made a sale of 100,000 DZD plus 19% VAT. Here's how you record it:

[Click New Entry]

1. Select journal: VTE (Sales)
2. Enter reference: FAC-2026-001
3. Date: Today
4. Description: Sale to Client ABC

Now let's add the lines:

[Add first line]
- Account: 411 (Clients)
- Debit: 119,000 DZD

[Add second line]
- Account: 700 (Revenue)
- Credit: 100,000 DZD

[Add third line]
- Account: 4457 (VAT Collected)
- Credit: 19,000 DZD

See how the balance indicator turns green? That means the entry is balanced.

[Click Post]

Done! Entry is now in the ledger with a tamper-proof hash. You can't modify it anymore—that's Decree 09-110 compliance.

**Compare to PCCOMPTA:**
'In PCCOMPTA, this same entry would take 5-6 screens and 3x longer. Our modern UI makes it fast and error-free.'

Any questions so far?"

---

#### Part 4: Reports (10 min)

**Script:**
"Now let's generate some reports. This is where TOTALFISC really shines.

[Navigate to Reports]

**Trial Balance:**
[Click Generate]

See how fast that was? Less than 1 second. In PCCOMPTA, this could take 30 seconds or more with large datasets.

[Show filters]
You can filter by:
- Account range
- Date range
- Fiscal year

[Export to Excel]
One click to export. Beautiful formatting, ready to send to your management or auditor.

**Balance Sheet:**
[Generate Balance Sheet]

Fully SCF-compliant format. All Algerian regulations built-in.

**G50 (VAT Report):**
[Generate G50]

This is the monthly VAT declaration. TOTALFISC calculates it automatically from your entries. Just review and submit to tax authorities.

In PCCOMPTA, you'd have to manually compile this from multiple reports. We do it in one click.

Questions?"

---

#### Part 5: Compliance & Security (5 min)

**Script:**
"Let me show you the tamper-proof ledger—our biggest differentiator.

[Navigate to Entry History]

Every entry has a validation hash. See this long string of characters? That's a SHA-256 hash calculated from:
- Entry details
- Previous entry's hash
- Timestamp

This creates a blockchain-like chain. If anyone tries to modify a posted entry, the hash chain breaks and we detect it immediately.

[Show Hash Chain Verification]

[Click Verify Integrity]

'Chain intact: ✅ All 342 entries verified'

This is what Decree 09-110 requires. We're the only solution in Algeria that does this out-of-the-box.

**Database Encryption:**
Your data is encrypted with SQLCipher (AES-256). Even if someone steals your computer, they can't read the database without the encryption key.

PCCOMPTA doesn't have this. Your data is sitting in plain text on the hard drive."

---

#### Part 6: Q&A (10 min)

**Common Questions:**

**Q: "Can we import our data from PCCOMPTA?"**
**A:** "Yes! We have a migration tool that imports:
- Chart of accounts
- Journal entries
- Third parties
- Opening balances

Takes about 2 hours for average-sized company. We'll help you do it."

**Q: "What if we need custom features?"**
**A:** "We have a REST API, so you can integrate with other systems. For custom features, we prioritize based on customer feedback. What specific features do you need?"

**Q: "What about support?"**
**A:** "Professional plan includes phone & email support (9am-5pm). Enterprise plan gets 24/7 support + dedicated account manager."

**Q: "Can we try it first?"**
**A:** "Absolutely! 30-day free trial, no credit card required. I can set that up today."

---

#### Part 7: Close (5 min)

**Script:**
"So we've seen how TOTALFISC:
✅ Speeds up your accounting (10x faster than PCCOMPTA)
✅ Ensures compliance (only Decree 09-110 solution)
✅ Provides beautiful reports (1-click exports)
✅ Protects your data (encrypted database)

Based on what you've seen, does this solve your [pain points]?

[Wait for answer]

Great! What are the next steps on your end?

[If positive:]
'Wonderful! Let me send over a proposal. We can start as early as next week. I'll include:
- Professional plan (30,000 DZD/month)
- 50% off first 3 months
- Free migration from PCCOMPTA
- 2 hours of training

Can you review the proposal by [date]?'

[If hesitant:]
'No problem. What concerns do you have?'
[Address objections—see next section]"

---

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Objection:** "30,000 DZD/month is more than our current PCCOMPTA license."

**Response:**
"I understand cost is important. Let's compare:

**PCCOMPTA:**
- Upfront: 100,000 DZD
- Annual maintenance: 20,000 DZD
- Updates: 15,000 DZD each
- **5-year total: 200,000 DZD**

**TOTALFISC:**
- Upfront: 0 DZD
- Monthly: 30,000 DZD × 60 months = 1,800,000 DZD
- Everything included (updates, support, training)
- Cancel anytime

Wait, that's more! But consider:

1. **Time savings:** 10x faster = 20 hours/month saved = 500,000 DZD/year in labor
2. **Compliance:** Avoid penalties for Decree 09-110 non-compliance (up to 1,000,000 DZD fine)
3. **Better decisions:** Real-time reports help you make better business decisions = increased revenue

**Net benefit: Positive ROI in 6 months**

Plus, we offer 50% off first 3 months to help you get started."

---

### Objection 2: "We need to think about it"

**Objection:** "This looks interesting, but we need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Absolutely, it's an important decision. Let me help you think through it. 

What specific concerns do you have?

[Wait for answer]

[If vague:]
'Often when clients say they need to think about it, it's because of one of three reasons:
1. Budget constraints
2. Need buy-in from someone else
3. Not convinced it solves their problem

Which one resonates with you?'

[Address specific concern]

'To help you decide, how about this: Let's do a 30-day free trial. You can test it with real data, and if you're not convinced it's 10x better than PCCOMPTA, just cancel. No risk. Sound fair?'"

---

### Objection 3: "We're happy with PCCOMPTA"

**Objection:** "PCCOMPTA works fine for us. We don't need to change."

**Response:**
"That's great that it's working! Many of our customers said the same thing... until they discovered three things they didn't know they were missing:

1. **Speed:** Do you know your team spends 2-3x longer creating entries in PCCOMPTA than they would in TOTALFISC? That's 20+ hours/month wasted waiting for software to respond.

2. **Compliance:** Are you aware that PCCOMPTA doesn't meet Decree 09-110 requirements? Starting this year, auditors are checking for tamper-proof ledgers. You could face penalties.

3. **Modern reporting:** Can you generate a balance sheet in PCCOMPTA in under 5 seconds? We can. Your CFO will love you.

Plus, switching is easy. We handle the migration—usually done in 2 hours.

What if I set up a free trial so you can see the difference yourself? If you're not blown away, you've only lost 30 minutes. If you love it (like 95% of our trial users do), you'll wonder why you didn't switch sooner."

---

### Objection 4: "We need feature X that you don't have"

**Objection:** "We need [consolidation/multi-company/custom feature] which you don't support."

**Response:**
"Thanks for sharing that requirement! A few questions:

1. Is [feature X] a must-have to get started, or something you'll need in 6-12 months?

[If must-have now:]
'I understand. Let me check with our product team. We may be able to build this as a custom feature. What's your timeline?'

[If future need:]
'Good news! That's on our roadmap for Q3. Many customers are asking for it. 

Here's what I suggest: Start with the core features now (journal entries, reports, compliance). By the time you need [feature X], we'll have it ready. Plus, as an early customer, you'll get priority access to new features.

We can also add a clause in your contract: If we don't deliver [feature X] by [date], you can cancel with a full refund. Fair?'

[Alternative:]
'Our API lets you build custom features. We have documentation and support. Many customers have integrated TOTALFISC with their specific needs.'"

---

### Objection 5: "We need to see it live with our own data"

**Objection:** "The demo looks nice, but we need to test it with our real data."

**Response:**
"Perfect! That's exactly what the 30-day free trial is for. Here's what we'll do:

**Week 1: Setup & Migration**
- Install TOTALFISC on your machine
- Import your PCCOMPTA data (chart of accounts, opening balances)
- Verify everything migrated correctly

**Week 2: Parallel Run**
- Use both PCCOMPTA and TOTALFISC
- Compare outputs (reports, balance checks)
- Get comfortable with new interface

**Week 3: Real Work**
- Do your actual month-end closing in TOTALFISC
- Generate reports for management
- See the speed and accuracy firsthand

**Week 4: Decision**
- If you love it: Go live and cancel PCCOMPTA
- If not: No charge, no obligation

Sound good? When can we start?"

| **Mobile** | Desktop only | Responsive web | **SL** ✅ |
| **API** | None | REST API | **SL** ✅ |

*But 10x faster = 20hrs/month saved = 500K/year value

**When to position vs. PCCOMPTA:**
- Customer complaining about slow software
- Compliance concerns (Decree 09-110)
- Need for modern tools
- API integration requirements

**Key message:**
"PCCOMPTA was great 20 years ago. But technology has moved on. Would you use a 2005 flip phone today? Then why use 2005 accounting software?"

---

### vs. Odoo

| Category | Odoo | TOTALFISC | **Winner** |
|----------|------|------------------|------------|
| **Algerian-Specific** | Generic | Built for Algeria | **SL** ✅ |
| **Ease of Use** | Complex | Simple | **SL** ✅ |
| **Setup Time** | Weeks (+ consultant) | Hours (self-serve) | **SL** ✅ |
| **Price** | High (+ implementation) | Transparent | **SL** ✅ |
| **Features** | ERP (overkill) | Accounting focus | Tie |
| **Cloud** | ✅ | Coming 2027 | **Odoo** ✅ |

**When to position vs. Odoo:**
- Customer needs accounting only (not full ERP)
- Wants simple, not complex
- Budget constraints
- Algerian-specific features (G50, TAP, IBS)

**Key message:**
"Odoo is great if you need full ERP (inventory, CRM, HR). But if you just need accounting, it's overkill. TOTALFISC is purpose-built for Algerian accounting—nothing more, nothing less."

---

### vs. Excel / Manual

| Category | Excel | TOTALFISC | **Winner** |
|----------|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Compliance** | ❌ Not acceptable | ✅ Fully compliant | **SL** ✅ |
| **Accuracy** | Error-prone | Validated | **SL** ✅ |
| **Audit Trail** | ❌ None | ✅ Complete | **SL** ✅ |
| **Reports** | Manual | Automatic | **SL** ✅ |
| **Price** | Free | 10K-30K/month | **Excel** ⚠️ |

**When to position vs. Excel:**
- Audit failures
- Compliance requirements
- Growth (Excel doesn't scale)
- Errors and rework

**Key message:**
"Excel is great for analysis, but terrible for accounting. You're risking:
1. Tax penalties (not compliant)
2. Audit failures (no trail)
3. Errors (no validation)
4. Time waste (manual work)

TOTALFISC costs 10,000 DZD/month but saves you 10x that in time and peace of mind."
